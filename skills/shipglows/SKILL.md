# ShipGlows

## Mission

Canonical public router. Preserve `project -> business/brand/product -> outcome
-> surface -> work item`, the named specialist and authority through the handoff.

## Scope Gate

The engine selects the smallest safe route and continues in this conversation.

## Required References

Resolve `$SHIPGLOWS_ROOT` from the process. On Windows, if empty, read its
current-user environment value, then `%USERPROFILE%\.shipglows\development-channel.json`.
A valid absolute `channel: linked` root containing `skills/000-shipglows/SKILL.md`
wins before the installed default `$HOME/.shipglows/runtime`. Verify root and
engine, then load `$SHIPGLOWS_ROOT/skills/000-shipglows/SKILL.md`.
If missing or invalid, stop visibly; never substitute a sibling or guessed checkout.

The engine owns conditional loaders; do not preload alias tables, domain skills
or every reference here. For non-trivial outcomes it loads
`$SHIPGLOWS_ROOT/skills/references/intent-to-outcome-autonomy.md`.

## Validation

Keep one owner, proof and authority limits. Clear bounded requests do not authorize
a chantier. Material uncertainty or scope growth stops for an operator-owned decision.

## Stop Conditions

Stop for missing canonical contracts or unresolved authority; never guess a fallback.

## Report Modes

Load `$SHIPGLOWS_ROOT/skills/references/reporting-contract.md` before reporting.
Default to concise active-language output; agent detail requires explicit request.
Continue safely agent-runnable authorized work before returning control.
