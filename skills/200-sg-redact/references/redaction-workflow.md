# Redaction Workflow

Use this index after `200-sg-redact` selects substantive long-form drafting. Keep brand voice, source evidence, public claims, copyright, application schema, declared-product governance, and quality gates intact.

## First Decision

Parse count (default `1`), format (`blog`, `informational`, or `editorial`; default `blog`), and optional topic. A missing topic may be inferred from sufficiently clear project truth; ask one targeted question only when materially different topics or author identities remain plausible.

Choose the required leaves directly from this index:

- Before selecting a public surface, reading brand/business/author truth, or writing metadata, load `references/redaction-context-and-governance.md`.
- When a topic needs selection, factual/current claims need proof, or an outline needs evidence, load `references/redaction-research-and-planning.md`.
- When creating or optimizing the article body, frontmatter, SEO structure, or CTA, load `references/redaction-drafting-and-optimization.md`.
- Before a readiness verdict or detailed report, load `references/redaction-quality-and-reporting.md`.

These leaves are independent siblings. Load only the branches selected by the current work; no leaf loads another leaf.

## Non-Negotiable Gates

- Never invent facts, quotes, statistics, customer proof, pricing, legal claims, or technical behavior. Current or unstable claims require fresh authoritative sources.
- Preserve the project's content schema and declared editorial surface. Do not invent a blog path, schema field, author identity, product promise, or first-person experience.
- Preserve copyright: synthesize sources, cite claims near their support, and do not reproduce long passages or reference screenshots.
- Match the content language and established brand voice. Missing context is a visible limitation, not permission to fabricate it.
- Use the shared content quality rubric for a near-final readiness score; blocked criteria prevent a `ready` verdict.

## Stop Conditions

Stop or report partial when the intended surface is undeclared, required source or author truth is unavailable, the requested claim cannot be supported, the application schema conflicts with proposed metadata, or publication would require unapproved durable/external action.
