# Question Contract

## Activation And Direct Routes

Load before user-facing routing, clarification, product, persona, scope, content,
source/target selection, risk, recovery questions and unfinished-chantier choices.
Not for internal analysis, progress updates, completed reports or subagents forbidden
to ask users. All paths below are canonical shared references; missing required
content stops the dependent decision. Metadata dependencies validate documents,
not mandatory full-body reads. Load only the triggered branch; never chain siblings.

- Before recommending a default, load `decision-quality-contract.md`.
- Material operator choices, unfinished-chantier choice blocks and useful completed
  continuation controls load `strategic-choice-contract.md`. It owns business
  alternatives and guided follow-up after `Questionner`, `Approfondir`, `Réorienter`.
- Before validation or mutation, load `mutation-plan-approval.md`; ordinary
  questions do not activate its full procedure.
- Before greenfield platform, blueprint or technology selection, load
  `question-greenfield-decisions.md`. Establish footprint before stack; do not
  silently exclude native apps, freeze unaccepted material technology, or re-ask
  accepted presets. Existing-stack work alone does not trigger this branch.
- Audit or maintenance of questioning loads `question-pressure-scenarios.md`;
  examples and history never load for ordinary questions.

## Question Versus Validation

Product and experience questions are proactive partnership: ask readily when
operator-owned intent, taste, audience, promise, journey or priority can sharpen
usefulness; blocking materiality is not required.
Continue safe in-scope work while the answer is pending when possible.
Validation requests are different: they interrupt execution and must be rare.

For a purely technical question, first attempt a professional evidence-backed decision.
Use repository evidence, accepted architecture, tests and current standards; ask
only if credible safe directions retain materially different consequences.
Never ask the operator to supervise implementation mechanics or localize files,
commands, internal owners, workflow phases or routine editorial decisions.

A question is not a validation request, and its answer never authorizes a mutation
outside existing authority. Apply bounded-request and Git-stewardship authority;
ordinary commit, push, synchronization, safe reconciliation and proven cleanup
never create a validation question. Dedicated safety gates and explicit restrictions
still apply. Material expansion requires its own authority; silence is no answer.

## Decide Or Ask

Proceed when the safe default is clear, in scope, reversible or low-risk,
compatible with project truth and best practices, and verifiable in this run.
Ask for operator-owned missing truth affecting behavior, scope, business promise,
audience, public claims, SEO, legal posture, cost, architecture, providers,
security/privacy, retention, auth/tenant/permissions, money, destructive effects,
deployment, staging, release, closure, ship risk or confidence in proof.
Never invent a target/default; report assumptions only if they affect trust or review.

Recommend the fastest, simplest path meeting the accepted product, architecture,
safety, performance and maintainability floor. Preserve trust, reversibility,
repo/spec conventions, mapped technical/editorial docs and public claim boundaries.
Do not trade missing proof for premature shipping or impose maximal excellence.
Explain a conflicting requested option; take a clear safe in-scope alternative or
ask. Name the condition favoring another option when relevant.

## Governing Context Recovery

For a material missing, stale, unknown or conflicting governing claim, show source,
gap, consequence, inspected evidence and proposed interpretation. Research discoverable facts; ask the ordering authority only for intent, priority, promise, appetite or
acceptance. Load `guided-business-product-discovery.md` for this recovery, ask one
decision at a time, retain the original chantier, and resume it after confirmation
and authorized persistence. A question never permits a governing-source write;
apply mutation authority unless that document family is already covered. An
irrelevant gap or stale date alone does not justify interruption.

## Required Shape

Ask at most one decision at a time unless inseparable. Use the active language,
plain consequences, a numeric heading and semantic emoji: `1. 🧭 [decision]`.
Include why the answer matters now, the recommended answer and reason when one
exists, 2–3 numbered practical options when useful, and an instruction to reply
by number or name another route. Use `✅` for the recommendation, distinct useful
icons for alternatives, at most one icon per labelled line; icons never replace
labels. Avoid internal jargon/model names unless they are the user’s decision; literal IDs may remain. Never ask broad
"anything else?" questions or make the operator invent direction from a blank page.
Unfinished choices concern product direction, priority or pause/continue, never
internal skills or commands; apply `reporting-contract.md` before reporting.
