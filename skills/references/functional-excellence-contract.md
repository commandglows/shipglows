# Functional Excellence Contract

## Purpose

Decide whether a proposed product, content item, experience, workflow, report,
rule, or other durable artifact deserves to exist in its chosen form before
specialized conception or implementation begins.

The governing sequence is:

`outcome -> functional excellence -> specialized conception -> implementation excellence -> proportional proof`

Functional excellence asks whether the form completely serves the intended
purpose. Implementation excellence asks whether that accepted form was built
professionally. Neither substitutes for the other.

## Core Invariant

Choose the simplest form that completely fulfills its evidenced function,
communicates its value and limits honestly, remains understandable without
hidden mediation, and stays coherent for the accepted horizon.

`Minimal` means no element without a responsibility. `Complete` means no
consequential responsibility omitted. Removing necessary safety, privacy,
accessibility, recovery, context, nuance, or proof is simplism, not excellence.

## Functional Dimensions

Evaluate every material form proportionally against these dimensions:

- **Useful:** it creates an evidenced user, customer, operator, business, or
  organizational result; internal elegance or novelty alone is insufficient.
- **Understandable:** the intended audience can identify what it is, what it
  does, how to act, and what happens next without needing hidden system or
  agent knowledge.
- **Unobtrusive:** structure, interface, prose, automation, and orchestration
  support the outcome without demanding attention for their own machinery.
- **Honest:** the promise, capability, state, source, limitation, trade-off,
  and proof are represented without inflation, simulation, or concealment.
- **Durable:** the form remains coherent and maintainable for the accepted
  horizon without trend dependence, planned confusion, or speculative scope.
- **Thorough:** consequential details, states, boundaries, exceptions, and
  recovery paths receive care proportional to their effect on people and trust.
- **Minimal but complete:** every retained element owns a responsibility and
  every required responsibility has an explicit owner, surface, or justified
  omission.

Innovation and aesthetics may strengthen these dimensions, but novelty and
visual quality are never independent evidence of functional excellence.

## Decision Gate

Before accepting a material form:

1. State the intended actor, trigger, result, horizon, and proof.
2. Assign every proposed element a functional responsibility.
3. Identify consequential responsibilities that the proposal does not cover.
4. Remove elements whose only justification is fashion, ceremony, imitation,
   internal convenience, or unsupported future possibility.
5. Restore any missing responsibility whose omission would weaken the outcome,
   understanding, honesty, durability, safety, recovery, nuance, or proof.
6. Pass the accepted form to the applicable product, design, content,
   experience, system, or implementation authority.

When a material dimension fails, revise or narrow the form, or report `partial`
with the failed dimension and concrete next outcome. Do not implement the wrong
form perfectly or use execution quality to hide weak functional reasoning.

## Surface Adaptations

- **Product:** each feature, setting, state, and choice advances a governed user
  outcome; capability accumulation without hierarchy fails the minimal gate.
- **Content:** each claim, section, example, and call to action serves audience
  intent; concision never removes required qualification, provenance, or nuance.
- **Design and experience:** hierarchy, affordances, feedback, motion, and
  decoration improve understanding, task completion, trust, accessibility, or
  meaningful brand expression; visual resemblance to an admired style proves
  nothing by itself.
- **ShipGlows mechanisms:** skills, rules, questions, reports, and orchestration
  expose the outcome and required decisions while keeping internal machinery
  out of the operator's way.
- **Durable artifacts:** a capable human can understand the outcome, decisions,
  owner, state, next action, and evidence without agent mediation.

## Relationship To Other Excellence Contracts

- Decision quality chooses the valuable outcome and activates this gate.
- Functional excellence accepts or rejects the form that will serve it.
- Specialized conception turns the accepted function into a coherent product,
  experience, content item, design, workflow, or system contract.
- Implementation excellence governs authored code and technical execution.
- Verification proves only the claims and dimensions applicable to the result.

This contract is direct and non-chaining: consuming skills load their own
specialized authorities rather than using this reference to select sibling
references.

## Inspiration Boundary

Dieter Rams's principles are historical inspiration for usefulness,
understandability, honesty, durability, thoroughness, unobtrusiveness, and
restraint. Drams demonstrates one playful digital interpretation. Neither is a
ShipGlows runtime dependency, universal aesthetic, component authority, or
substitute for evidence on the actual audience, outcome, and surface.

## Stop Conditions

Stop, revise, narrow, or report `partial` when:

- the function, actor, audience, outcome, or accepted horizon is unresolved
- novelty, aesthetics, a reference, or implementation effort is the only case
  for the chosen form
- the audience needs hidden mediation to understand or use the result
- a promise, capability, state, limitation, source, or proof is misleading
- minimalism removes a consequential responsibility
- thoroughness becomes feature, prose, process, or proof accumulation without
  outcome value
- durability becomes speculative architecture or resistance to useful learning
- the new doctrine or mechanism adds structure without replacing ambiguity,
  drift, maintenance burden, or another named weak point

## Pressure Scenarios

- `FEX-PRODUCT-ACCUMULATION`: a useful feature gains options with no distinct
  user responsibility; remove or subordinate them before acceptance.
- `FEX-CONTENT-CONCISION`: shorter copy drops the qualification required for an
  honest claim; restore the qualification even when the result is less minimal.
- `FEX-DESIGN-IMITATION`: an interface resembles Braun or Drams but weakens
  affordance, accessibility, or task completion; visual resemblance cannot pass.
- `FEX-SYSTEM-OBTRUSION`: a ShipGlows report exposes routing and lifecycle
  machinery instead of the outcome; keep the proof while removing operator noise.
- `FEX-MINIMAL-INCOMPLETE`: a simple form omits recovery, safety, context,
  nuance, or proof; reject it as incomplete.
- `FEX-THOROUGH-CLUTTER`: a comprehensive artifact accumulates sections or
  checks with no owned responsibility; remove the ceremonial material.
- `FEX-DURABLE-SPECULATION`: future-proofing delays current value without
  demonstrated horizon pressure; keep replaceable boundaries, not hypothetical scope.
