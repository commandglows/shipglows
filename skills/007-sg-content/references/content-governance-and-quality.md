# Content Governance and Quality

For public content, inspect the project content map and declared surface, page intent, claim register, blog/article policy, and runtime schema. Produce Editorial Update Plan and Claim Impact Plan when relevant. A missing required surface blocks creation pending a spec or explicit surface decision.

Align title, slug, H1, intro, H2/H3, CTA, and internal links around one honest promise. Improve the real reader job, funnel role, adjacency, and discoverability without outgrowing product truth. Strong unused title variants may become truthful subheads. ShipGlows-led workflows should not be reframed as operator homework; distinguish what the requester supplied from what the skills transform.

Resolve routine structure, cross-links, wording, and promise mismatch autonomously. Ask only for business truth, audience nuance, positioning, product emphasis, or competing surface/funnel choices that materially change the result.

## Mandatory Article Locale Parity

Before creating or materially updating an article, resolve all declared public article locales from project governance and the runtime schema. Treat every mapped locale peer as one atomic deliverable: draft or update the source-faithful body, locale-native title, description, summary, slug, CTA, internal links, publication state, article identity, and alternate-locale mapping in the same workstream. Routine translation is agent-owned; never leave it as operator homework or an untracked follow-up.

Block readiness, closure, and delivery for `ARTICLE-LOCALE-MISSING` when a declared peer does not exist, `ARTICLE-LOCALE-STALE` when a material source change does not update every peer, or `ARTICLE-LOCALE-METADATA` when identity, publication state, or locale mapping diverges. Adapt idiom rather than translating literally, but preserve claim strength, caveats, and meaning. A single-locale article is valid only when the article surface is explicitly monolingual by project or operator decision; never infer that exception from a missing translation.
